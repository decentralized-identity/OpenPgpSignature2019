      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
This specification describes the OpenPGP Signature Suite created in 2019 for the
Linked Data Signatures [[LD-SIGNATURES]] specification. It uses the RDF
Dataset CANONICALIZATION Algorithm [[RDF-DATASET-CANONICALIZATION]] to transform the
input document into its canonical form. It uses SHA-256 [[RFC6234]] as the
<a>message digest algorithm</a> and the OpenPGP sign detached algorithm defined in
OpenPGP [[RFC4880]] as the <a>signature algorithm</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>
The following terms are used to describe concepts involved in the
generation and verification of the Linked Data Signature 2019
<a>signature suite</a>.
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>signature suite</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
A specified set of cryptographic primitives typically consisting of
a canonicalization algorithm, a message digest algorithm, and a signature
algorithm that are bundled together by cryptographers for developers
for the purposes of safety and convenience.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>canonicalization algorithm</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
An algorithm that takes an input document that has more than one possible
representation and always transforms it into a canonical form. This process is
sometimes also called CANONICALIZATION.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>message digest algorithm</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
An algorithm that takes an input message and produces a cryptographic
output message that is often many orders of magnitude smaller than the
input message. These algorithms are often 1) very fast, 2)
non-reversible, 3) cause the output to change significantly when even one
bit of the input message changes, and 4) make it infeasible to find two
different inputs for the same output.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>signature algorithm</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
An algorithm that takes an input message and produces an output value where the
receiver of the message can mathematically verify that the message has not
been modified in transit and came from someone possessing a particular secret.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <h2>The 2019 OpenPGP Signature Suite</h2>

      <p>
The 2019 OpenPGP <a>signature suite</a> MUST be used in
conjunction with the signing and verification algorithms in the
Linked Data Signatures [[LD-SIGNATURES]] specification. The suite consists of
the following algorithms:

      <h2>Modification to Algorithms</h2>

      <p>
This signature suite uses detached Open PGP Signatures as described in [[RFC4880]]. 
The signature algorithm used is determined by the key type provided, 
armored OpenPGP keys contain the information necessary to know the specific method,
and this flexibility supports integration with exiting software systems that use OpenPGP, GPG or PGP.
The steps to construct and verify the digital signature are defined below.
      <p>

      <section>
        <h3>Modifications to Signature Algorithm</h3>

        <p>
The <var>digital signature algorithm</var> defined in Section 11.4:
Signature Algorithm takes <var>tbs</var>, a <var>privateKey</var>,
and </var><var>options</var> as inputs and produces a
<var>signatureValue</var> as output.
        </p>
        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>
Take <var>tbs</var>, which is the data to be signed, an unlocked private key and options dictionary as input to the signature suite.
          </li>
          <li>
Perform the
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-11.4">sign detached</a> digital signature algorithm specified in Section 11.4 of
[[RFC4880]] and return the result as <em>signatureValue</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <em>signatureValue</em> will be in one of the two following formats depending on options:
            <code>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: OpenPGP.js...</code>.
            or when passed with compact option:
            <code>wl4EARMIAAYFAlw6KOAACgkQSnoBzSruDWC...</code>.
                      </li>
        </ol>

      </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Modifications to Signature Verification Algorithm</h3>

        <p>
The <var>digital signature algorithm</var> defined in Section 11.4:
Signature Verification Algorithm takes the value to be verified,
<em>tbv</em>, the <em>public key</em> to the signature algorithm
and returns a boolean value.
        </p>
        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>
Take <var>tbv</var> and perform the
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-11.4">Sign Detached</a>
digital signature verification algorithm specified in
Section 11.4 of [[RFC4880]]. If the result is a valid signature, return
<code>true</code>, otherwise return <code>false</code>.
          </li>
        </ol>

      <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
      <p>
The following section describes security considerations that developers
implementing this specification should be aware of in order to create secure
software.
      </p>

<div class="issue">TODO: We need to add a complete list of security
considerations.</div>

<ol class="security_considerations">
  <li>
    This Signature Suite relies on the security and assumptions made by OpenPGP.js. 
    Or any compatibile OpenPGP library implemented in a different language. 
    We assume specifcally that sign and verify deteched are implemented safely for 
    all supported key types.
