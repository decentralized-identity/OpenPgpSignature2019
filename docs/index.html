      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
This specification describes the OpenPGP Signature Suite created in 2018 for the
Linked Data Signatures [[LD-SIGNATURES]] specification. It uses the RDF
Dataset CANONICALIZATION Algorithm [[RDF-DATASET-CANONICALIZATION]] to transform the
input document into its canonical form. It uses SHA-256 [[RFC6234]] as the
<a>message digest algorithm</a> and the RS256 algorithm defined in
JSON Web Signatures [[RFC7515]] as the <a>signature algorithm</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>
The following terms are used to describe concepts involved in the
generation and verification of the Linked Data Signature 2018
<a>signature suite</a>.
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>signature suite</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
A specified set of cryptographic primitives typically consisting of
a canonicalization algorithm, a message digest algorithm, and a signature
algorithm that are bundled together by cryptographers for developers
for the purposes of safety and convenience.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>canonicalization algorithm</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
An algorithm that takes an input document that has more than one possible
representation and always transforms it into a canonical form. This process is
sometimes also called CANONICALIZATION.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>message digest algorithm</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
An algorithm that takes an input message and produces a cryptographic
output message that is often many orders of magnitude smaller than the
input message. These algorithms are often 1) very fast, 2)
non-reversible, 3) cause the output to change significantly when even one
bit of the input message changes, and 4) make it infeasible to find two
different inputs for the same output.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>signature algorithm</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
An algorithm that takes an input message and produces an output value where the
receiver of the message can mathematically verify that the message has not
been modified in transit and came from someone possessing a particular secret.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <h2>The 2018 OpenPGP Signature Suite</h2>

      <p>
The 2018 OpenPGP <a>signature suite</a> MUST be used in
conjunction with the signing and verification algorithms in the
Linked Data Signatures [[LD-SIGNATURES]] specification. The suite consists of
the following algorithms:

      <table class="simple">
        <thead>
          <th>Parameter</th>
          <th>Value</th>
          <th>Specification</th>

      <h2>Modification to Algorithms</h2>

      <p>
This signature suite uses a constrained profile of JSON Web Signatures
which is specified in [[RFC7797]]. The signature algorithm used is
the JSON Web Signature implementation of the RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 algorithm.
The steps to construct and verify the digital signature are defined below.
      <p>

      <section>
        <h3>Modifications to Signature Algorithm</h3>

        <p>
The <var>digital signature algorithm</var> defined in Section 7.1:
Signature Algorithm takes <var>tbs</var>, a <var>privateKey</var>,
and </var><var>options</var> as inputs and produces a
<var>signatureValue</var> as output.
        </p>
        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>
Take <var>tbs</var>, which is the data to be signed, as input and generate
a JOSE Web Signature structure where the headers are:
<code>{"alg":"RS256","b64":false,"crit":["b64"]}</code> and the
payload is a URL-safe Base64 encoding of <var>tbs</var>.
          </li>
          <li>
Perform the
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#section-3.3">RS256</a>
JSON Web Signature digital signature algorithm specified in Section 3.3 of
[[RFC7518]] and return the result as <em>signatureValue</em>.
          </li>
        </ol>

      </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Modifications to Signature Verification Algorithm</h3>

        <p>
The <var>digital signature algorithm</var> defined in Section 7.2:
Signature Verification Algorithm takes the value to be verified,
<em>tbv</em>, the <em>public key</em> to the signature algorithm
and returns a boolean value.
        </p>
        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>
Take <var>tbv</var> and perform the
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#section-3.3">RS256</a>
JSON Web Signature digital signature verification algorithm specified in
Section 3.3 of [[RFC7518]]. If the result is a valid signature, return
<code>true</code>, otherwise return <code>false</code>.
          </li>
        </ol>
